	<h2>The Ethical Implications of Self-Driving Cars</h2>
	<h3>Definition</h3>
	<p>
		Technology has been advancing at a rapid rate in recent years, eventually leading to the research and development of Self-Driving cars.
		These developments have also lead to questions concerning the safety of these cars, as well as the tougher questions regarding how the AI should act in
		situations where a human could be put in danger as a consequence of the Self-Driving AIâ€™s decision.
	</p>

	<h3>Justification</h3>
	<p>
		With current introduction to Tesla's trendy autopilot mode it makes this topic relevant to our current day, as having a 'safer' version of self driving
		cars increased the amount of people who have used this autopilot feature bringing this question of if it were to crash whose fault would it be to be
		more pertinent than ever.
		Due to these reasons we as a group came to a conclusion to pick the topic of The Ethics of Self Driving Cars.
	</p>

	<h3>Importance</h3>
	<p>
		The topic of self-driving cars is an ever-important area with autonomous vehicles becoming closer and closer to being common on our roads.
		This raises critically important ethical questions surrounding what would happen were someone to be injured by a vehicle running on autopilot and who
		would be at fault.
		These questions must be resolved before autonomous cars become mainstream.
		For this reason, the topic of ethics surrounding autonomous vehicles is extremely important to research.
