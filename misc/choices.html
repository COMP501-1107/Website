	<p>Self-driving cars have their benefits in the future as they continue to be developed such as improved efficiency and increase productivity on 
		the road as they would be coded to maximise their efficiency especially among other self-driving cars. As the cars are further developed we 
		will be able to see a reduction in traffic accidents. Although there would be in improvement in driving once we remove human error, the chances 
		of a collision occurring is still there (Ryan, 2020, p. 1185-1208). </p>
	
	<p1>In the current day it seems that people despite knowing the fact that self-driving cars are more beneficial to society they seem to still be 
		reluctant to want to ride or purchase cars that support the self-driving capability (Tan, Zhao, & Yang, 2022).</p1>
	
	<p2>Our current choices to make self driving cars more accepted is to improve their emotion design allowing people to feel less anxious while 
		riding in these cars. This can be done by advertising the safety features allowing the customers to gain a different perspective on the 
		self-driving cars (Tan, Zhao, & Yang, 2022). As for the future it is much harder to be able to avoid people losing their jobs if the 
		implementation of self-driving cars becomes more prevalent. I would suggest that the self driving cars are used for long distance travel 
		allowing it to be more efficient as it travels long distance and allowing people to work as drivers within smaller regions. The carsâ€™ 
		programming would also need to be heavily protected to prevent hackers from abusing the program and vandalising property.</p2>
