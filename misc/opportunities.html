	<p>In our current society, 94% of severe traffic accidents occur due of human error, and consequently approximately 1.35 million people die per year from traffic accidents (Filiz, 2020, p. 1). Most accidents being caused by inadequate surveillance, distractions, and misjudgements (Filiz, 2020, p. 6). With this information we can theorise if driverless cars were to become mainstream these numbers would be reduced as there would be less chance for human error to be a factor in traffic accidents. Driverless cars would also remove the risk of driving while impaired, creating safer roads for everyone. This means that, should we manage to  perfect the self-driving AI, driverless cars would contribute to society and human well-being in accordance with the AMC code of ethics (AMC Council, 2018). .</p>
