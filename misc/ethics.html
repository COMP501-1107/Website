	<h2>Nate: Ethical Reflections</h2>
	<p>
		In doing this assignment I have learnt about several important ethical issues regarding autonomous vehicles.
		There are a couple of professional ethical principles that self-driving AIs in their current state are at risk of breaching.
		In particular, the main potential breaches are the avoidance of harm and not acting in a discriminatory or biased manner.
	</p>
	<p>
		The risk of harm is due to self-driving AI having to have prepared for situations in which it must choose an option that it decided would inflict the
		least amount of harm.
		I find this quite problematic because this AI's programming would have a case in which it decides purposefully to inflict harm to some entity, even if
		it is a justifiable decision based on the AI determining that that outcome would be the least damaging.
		For instance, it is logically obvious that when given the choice between crashing into a car or into a bicycle that it would be better to crash into the
		car; however the fact that this outcome includes a purposeful collision may be quite unsettling.
		People would not want to drive in or be around a vehicle that may lead to them being crashed into on purpose, or otherwise being at risk of being harmed
		by a purposeful decision made by an AI.
	</p>
	<p>
		The determination of these priorities would also having some unavoidable level of bias built into the methodology.
		I can see some potential issues with this.
		For instance, the best moral decision may not be able to be made properly if not all factors are taken into account by the AI.
		There is also a more sinister level of bias in what amount of training data is given to the AI which can lead to, for instance, darker-skinned people
		having lower detection rates than lighter-skinned people, which is obviously a massive problem.
		Biases need to be addressed in the training data stage before the output is loaded into the autonomous AI.
	</p>
	<p>
		Overall I feel like there are quite a few ethical issues regarding self-driving vehicles that I feel are still yet to be thoroughly addressed, which
		must be done decisively before autonomous vehicles become common on our roads.
		There is also the social aspect that must be looked into, at what the general population thinks of autonomous vehicles and the potential ethical/moral
		decisions to be made by them while driving.
		People may remain uncomfortable with them for some time and get put off self-driving vehicles permanently if these issues with self-driving AI seep into
		public consciousness.
		I think more should be done to alleviate people's potential concerns about autonomous vehicles before they become mainstream.
