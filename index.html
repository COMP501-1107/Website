		This mock-up site is intended to support your team project so you can take this as a set of files
		and as a starting point and adapt it to your preference.
	</p>
	<p>
		The site is not particularly well presented, but as the site uses HTML and has been styled with CSS
		it can be regarded as a <em>"minimum viable product"</em> for the purposes of this project.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <em>Process Support</em> Links provides guidance which will be needed for presenting your final project.
